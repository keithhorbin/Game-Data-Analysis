## Task:
Using the supplied CSV, import and manipulate the data with the end focus of generating a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data to be able to provide meaningful analysis and insights including and provide observed trends:

Purchasing Analysis (Gender) 
Age Demographics
Top Spenders

Most Profitable Items

## Observed trend analysis:
1. The majority of players ranged in ages from 18 – 29, 76.74% of the sample and were 76.47% of total spend. Most age brackets spent at or below the average price of $3.05 with only the 35 – 39 and <10 age brackets spending more than the average.  
2. While males make up 84% of the total players, in regards to avg total purchase males are out spent by females by $.40 on average and by non-binary or undisclosed individuals by $.49 on average. Females and non-binary or undisclosed individuals were more likely to spend more than the average price of $3.05 while males tended to spend under the average. 162 screen names had more than one item purchased (20.8%) with only 38 (4.9%) purchasing more than 2 items.     
3. It doesn’t appear that there is a singular item that is a “cash cow” of the game. “Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm” was the highest purchased at 12 times and highest Total Purchase Value at $50.76. However, it only accounted for 1.5% of items sold and 2.1% of total purchase value.
